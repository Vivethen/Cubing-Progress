### Techniques learned to improve solve times
* Learned how to have more fluent motion when rotating the cube
* Faced the side I would solve infront of me so I know what to do before I actually solve
* Practiced a good amount before actually time myself to get muscle memory involved
* Tried finding and using my own technique to go along with the one I learned
